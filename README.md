✈️ Airline Passenger Experience & Service Quality Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Power BI report built using an airline passenger satisfaction dataset. The report is designed with two dashboards (pages) connected through navigation buttons, allowing users to move smoothly between high-level insights and detailed service analysis.

The goal of this project is to understand passenger satisfaction, service quality, and operational impact while comparing actual satisfaction vs expected satisfaction to identify performance gaps.

📊 Dashboards Overview

🔹 Dashboard 1: Passenger Experience & Satisfaction Overview

  -> This dashboard provides a consolidated view of overall passenger satisfaction and experience.

  -> Key insights covered:

    => Overall passenger count and satisfaction rate

    => Actual satisfaction rate vs expected satisfaction rate comparison

    => Impact of arrival and departure delays on satisfaction

  -> Satisfaction analysis by:

    => Customer type (First-time vs Returning)

    => Gender

    => Age group

    => Travel class

    => Type of travel
    
    =>  Class-wise delay distribution and its effect on satisfaction

  -> Features:

    => Interactive slicers for focused analysis

    => Clear-slicers button for quick reset
    
    => Clean layout for easy interpretation

🔹 Dashboard 2: Service Quality & Performance Insights

  -> This dashboard focuses on evaluating airline service performance and identifying improvement areas.
  -> It can be accessed directly from Dashboard 1 using a navigation button.
  
  -> Key insights covered:

    => Average ratings of key airline services
    
    => Top 5 and Bottom 5 services based on passenger ratings
    
    => Inflight service assessment
